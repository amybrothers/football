About storm-chaser
======
This is The Denver Post's first foray into truly mobile-first responsive, interactive storytelling on the web. Inspired by projects like Snow Fall, The Jockey and Out in the Great Alone, our goal is simply to create an immersive narrative that works across devices and tells a story with all relevant elements included as intuitively as possible.

Utilizes HTML5 video, Adobe Edge Animate HTML5 animation, and JavaScript to create immersion and HTML5/CSS3 for responsive design.
