		<p class="lead">They had been chasing the beast for little more than 10 minutes, inching toward it with a series of 90-degree turns on the checkerboard maze of roads that sliced through the wheat and flax fields of central Oklahoma. Tim Samaras sat in the front passenger seat of the white Chevrolet Cobalt, considering the next move in a storm chaser&rsquo;s game of cat-and-mouse with the massive tornado that thundered across the landscape.</p>

		<p>The 55-year-old Coloradan, an iconic figure in this subculture who straddled celebrity and serious research, worked from a time-tested playbook: Determine the tornado&rsquo;s path, carefully maneuver his vehicle ahead of it, deploy three probes of his own invention to collect close-range data and then scamper out of the way.</p>

		<p>Next to Samaras, Carl Young gripped the steering wheel and intermittently controlled a camcorder that also captured their running dialogue &mdash; a mixture of storm narration, navigational give-and-take and unwelcome driving tips. Though less renowned than Samaras among the general public, Young, 45, of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., carried considerable cachet within the storm-chasing community as a meticulous forecaster, devoted researcher and engaging personality. </p>

		<p>Paul Samaras, Tim&rsquo;s 24-year-old son, sat silent in the back seat, audibly detached from the scenes he was videotaping with his own equipment. Though he had no speaking part in this portion of the day&rsquo;s drama, his very presence spoke to the way his emerging talents had happily intersected his father&rsquo;s passion.</p>
		<p>They skirted the edge of mayhem along with dozens of other chasers, some also intent on taking measure of the tornado&rsquo;s elusive, evolving parameters. Others buzzed the area on a meteorological thrill ride, video cameras in hand, venturing as close as they dared to shoot images that in short order would find a worldwide audience through social media.</p>
		<p>Storm chasers of every stripe converged on Friday, May 31, 2013, drawn by the promise of exactly what now unfolded &mdash; a breathtaking tornado of monumental proportions. Their presence highlighted the sometimes dangerous intersection of scientific inquiry and extreme sport, when chasers and locals turn out in critical mass to stalk often unpredictable and potentially lethal twisters.</p>
		<p>This supercell thunderstorm, an imposing phenomenon that spawned vortices spinning within vortices like tornadic Russian nesting dolls, raced along with gathering speed. A terrifying, beautiful thing to behold.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you in movie mode?&rdquo; Samaras said, as Young handed him his video camera.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Young replied. &ldquo;Make sure it&rsquo;s in focus.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Together, the three men made their way in the Cobalt east along Reno Street, just south of the town of El Reno, a short jog on Interstate 40 west of Oklahoma City.</p>
		<p>Moments later, caution kicked in. Samaras, who&rsquo;d spent decades stalking storms and anticipating their behavior, sensed trouble. Even as the Cobalt churned through the wind in an effort to outrun the storm so they could place the probes, Samaras reconsidered their speed and course, calculating whether it would be wise to hang back and let the tornado pass in front of them.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK, we&rsquo;ve gotta be careful in case this thing wraps up,&rdquo; he said, fearing that the tornado could initiate a gradual left turn. &ldquo;I would slow up here, &rsquo;cause if this thing starts moving to the north, we&rsquo;re in trouble. Slow up. We&rsquo;re almost right alongside of it here. Slow up! Let the thing go off to the east a little bit, see if that thing transverses us.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They didn&rsquo;t appear to realize that they already had ventured into the transparent edge of the huge tornado&rsquo;s rotation. Sub-vortices ripped across fields to the south. In the moment, Young saw opportunity beckon.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can pass it right now, Tim,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem. Really. I mean, I have a clear shot.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got debris in the air,&rdquo; said Samaras, and the loud thud of an object striking the car punctuated his words. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Just ahead, the north-south intersection of Reformatory Road offered an escape valve.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Very large hail,&rdquo; Samaras said. &ldquo;OK, we&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ve got a turn to the north which is good. Got this inflow jet, so we&rsquo;re gonna follow it around to the north and get outta here. Now we go up north and then east.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Behind the wheel, Young felt the Cobalt straining against winds that likely topped 70 mph. Though they assumed this to be inflow, the wind produced as the tornado sucked air into its expanding rotation, in fact it was the larger circulation of the tornado itself.</p>
		<p>Samaras plotted a new course. They would head north on Reformatory and give the tornado a wide berth. Then they would resume the chase to the east, making up lost time as the funnels carved meandering arcs across the countryside.</p>
		<p>It was the smart play, the safe play. It was the strategy that, on almost any day in Tornado Alley, would offer the best chance to intercept the tornado on their own terms, to plant the probes and — with some luck — reap the potentially huge research benefits of a calculated risk.</p>
		<p>Young&rsquo;s camcorder rolled, collecting images and capturing some of the last verbal exchanges among the storm chasers in the car before the beast suddenly turned on them.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, on the highways and backroads of the Midwest, other lines converged. Storm chasers, a community of severe weather junkies, plotted routes toward Oklahoma City, drawn by the promise of a meteorological performance of such magnitude that it occurs fewer than a half-dozen times a season.</p>
		<p>Like many of them, Tim Samaras had been touring the region for weeks.</p>
		<p>A largely self-taught scientist with a r&eacute;sum&eacute; that encompassed both academia and entertainment &mdash; and a reputation for caution and safety &mdash; Samaras in some ways seemed the last storm chaser who would run afoul of a tornado.</p>
		<p>Although he had no college degree, he exhibited a rare combination of traits: the intuitive instincts of an engineer, creativity born of endless electronic tinkering, a self-taught grasp of atmospheric science and a calm that allowed him to stay focused under pressure. By marrying those qualities to an elemental fascination with storms, and producing a remarkable track record of research, Samaras became highly regarded inside and outside the storm chasing community.</p>
		<p>Both academic colleagues and chasers can tick off a succession of Samaras&rsquo;s triumphs the way a baseball fan might recount the accomplishments of a star player. Bowdle, S.D., May 22, 2010. Aurora, Neb., June 17, 2009. Manchester, S.D., June 24, 2003. At Manchester, in what may be his most famous field achievement, Samaras deployed a probe in front of a tornado and gathered data indicating a world-record pressure drop within the twister.</p>

		<p>The indirect, practical applications of such data extend to engineering, and creating structures better able to withstand the high winds. But the holy grail of his research was to move toward understanding tornado formation in ways that would lead to greater warning times than the current average of around 13 minutes.</p>
		<p>Samaras earned his respect in academia largely through his creativity and the way he designed and built his own instruments on a shoestring budget. He transformed a hulking, outdated camera into a million-frames-a-second behemoth he dubbed the Big Kahuna. He had a patent pending on a device that would measure wind speed in three dimensions. The 45-pound probes he attempted to place directly in the paths of approaching tornadoes have recorded key meteorological data and even have taken photos from within the twisters.</p>
		<p>Those probes, which he nicknamed &ldquo;turtles,&rdquo; solved a longstanding problem. Previous instruments couldn&rsquo;t stand up to the high winds, but Samaras engineered a signature design that was &ldquo;as opposite of an airplane wing as you could get,&rdquo; said Bill Gallus, a professor of meteorology at Iowa State University. Instead of the device blowing away or being destroyed, the design uses the force of the winds to keep it in place against the ground, facilitating data collection.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There had been government-funded research projects going back a few decades that thought they could get instruments in front of a tornado, but they never seemed to work,&rdquo; said Gallus, whose ISU program developed a relationship with Samaras that put students in the field with him during storm chasing season.</p>
		<p>Chasers run the gamut, from arms-length observers to adrenaline addicts whose enthusiasm and pursuit of extreme video outpaces their judgment. But Samaras tracked supercells for more than 30 years, from long-ago day trips on Colorado&rsquo;s Eastern Plains with his younger brother, Jim, to the scientific expeditions that came to define his professional life.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;It was about a fascination,&rdquo; said 53-year-old Jim Samaras. &ldquo;He had a strong passion for it. He decided to go out there with minimal training, just like a lot of them did in those days. He understood enough about air currents that he knew what to look for.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Eventually, day trips turned into week-long roadies. Jim stayed behind, unable to break away from work, while he watched his older brother&rsquo;s interest grow into full-blown scientific inquiries. That probing, problem-solving approach drove Samaras from the time he was a kid growing up in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, transfixed by <a href="http://www.stormtrack.org/library/fringe/oz.htm" title="THE OZ TORNADO by Tim Marshall" target="_blank">annual airings of &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz.&rdquo;</a> He would walk away from the movie after the tornado scene.</p>
		<p>Though barely more than an average student, Samaras loved to learn on his own. He plowed through do-it-yourself Radio Shack electronic project kits and then moved on to new challenges. One year, his father put an ad in the newspaper seeking old, free electronic equipment, then drove around picking it up in his truck before piling it in Tim&rsquo;s bedroom and telling him, &ldquo;Merry Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Most of the items were old radios, which Samaras methodically dismantled and reassembled. In the process, he cultivated an interest in ham radio, learned Morse code and, in his early teens, earned his operator&rsquo;s license.</p>
		<p>After graduating from Alameda High School in 1976, he took a job fixing electronics. A few years later, he started working at the University of Denver, where he shot high-speed photographs of explosions. His affinity for photography stemmed at least in part from his dad, who did professional wedding photography when he wasn&rsquo;t managing his hobby store.</p>
		<p>Before he left DU, Samaras claimed that massive old high-speed camera, an outdated analog device that shot 50,000 frames per second. He retooled it and lugged it all across the country to study lightning.</p>

		<p>He worked for Applied Research Associates, a scientific research and engineering firm, for a decade and honed his skills on a variety of projects, from the barometric pressure-measuring probes he would later employ in storm chasing to the crash investigation of TWA Flight 800 in 1996.</p>
		<p>From there, he launched the research group known simply as TWISTEX &mdash; short for Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in/near Tornadoes Experiment. It became the definitive outlet that combined his passion for weather with his drive to tinker and build.</p>
		<p>Samaras somehow always managed to lash together his talents in the pursuit of both making a living and his passions. He invested in real estate. Jim showed him how to &ldquo;flip&rdquo; houses. Two years ago, he found an ideal property for himself and his wife, Kathy &mdash; a foreclosure on some acreage out on the Eastern Plains in Bennett where he&rsquo;d have plenty of room and could put up radio and weather towers without irking the neighbors. Plus, he had room for a full machine shop where he could breathe life into his ideas.</p>
		<p>In recent months, Paul, who shared his parents&rsquo; house in Bennett, had become a fixture on TWISTEX road trips as his budding interest in photography and videography merged with his father&rsquo;s passion for severe weather. But while Tim already had attained standing, Paul remained a promising work in progress. Though quiet and shy, Paul had begun to emerge from his shell as his work distinguished itself.</p>

		<p>Samaras and Young didn&rsquo;t usually run <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVUHdCGqiSI" title="El Reno OK Tornado with Spotter Network Dots - YouTube.com" target="_blank">the Spotter Network</a> live during a chase. The network, technically a nonprofit that serves the storm chasing community as well as government agencies, uses GPS coordinates of members&rsquo; smart phones to track them during a weather event and post their positions on an online map.</p>
		<p>When <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/storm-chasers/videos/tribute-tim-samaras-carl-young.htm" title="Remembering Tim Samaras and Carl Young - Discovery Channel tribute" target="_blank">Samaras began to appear on television in 2008</a> as one of the stars in the Discovery Channel&rsquo;s reality series &ldquo;Storm Chasers,&rdquo; he gained a new level of celebrity. His appearances with the TWISTEX crew in four of the five seasons before the show was canceled in 2012 enhanced his already popular standing.</p>
		<p>It had become more and more of a challenge to carve out work time when the team moved in the same geographic circles as the growing herd of extreme weather buffs.</p>
		<p>Although the TV gig went a long way toward financing his scientific work, Samaras eventually found himself doing a delicate dance to reconcile research and showbiz.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Tim had any desire to be on TV in the first place,&rdquo; said Laubach, who appeared on the show with him for the last few years. &ldquo;But it was a funding source for us. That was the trade-off.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As gracefully as he seemed to straddle the line between science and celebrity, Samaras also negotiated the practical elements of his passion. He tempered the pulse-thumping pace of the chase with a cool demeanor that allowed him to focus on planting his probes amid meteorological chaos.</p>

		<p class="lead">About 3 miles to the north, Tim Samaras, his son Paul and Carl Young, having veered away from a close call with the tornado just moments earlier on Reno Street, cruised north on Reformatory Road.</p>
		<p>Samaras answered his cellphone &mdash; an apparent media call that, despite the pressures of the pursuit, he responded to with a quick assessment of what he predicted to be a &ldquo;long-lived tornado.&rdquo; As he talked, the Cobalt turned east onto Reuter Road, another of the unpaved routes that criss-cross the expanse of farm fields.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; said Young. &ldquo;Here we go. Should get a view of it again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The chase resumed, with the TWISTEX crew tracking the tornado to the south and moving east at a good clip. Meanwhile, a shroud of precipitation descended between the tornado and the Cobalt as Young guided it along Reuter Road.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s pretty well rain-wrapped now,&rdquo; Samaras said. &ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s hard to tell what the hell it&rsquo;s doing now. Probably just a gigantic wedge, we can&rsquo;t see it anymore. ... OK, stop sign up here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>While Samaras chipped in driving tips and Young deflected them, they continued tracking the tornado that appeared less distinct against the gauzy wall of rain. A blast of wind shuddered the vehicle.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What a beast,&rdquo; Samaras said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just doing everything we can to keep up with this thing.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re probably going to have to cross 81, if this road is good,&rdquo; Samaras continued, &ldquo;and then try and drop down if we&rsquo;ve got some viable roads.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They pulled up to the intersection of Reuter and U.S. 81 behind a Toyota Yaris and watched it cross the divided highway. The Cobalt followed. Although the road was dry, rain to the south made it difficult to discern the twister&rsquo;s movement, much less the violently skittering sub-vortices within.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This thing is moving 40 miles an hour, 30-40 miles an hour to the east,&rdquo; Samaras said, sensing that the tornado&rsquo;s speed had picked up.</p>
		<p>His rough calculation was nearly accurate, except for one thing: the tornado&rsquo;s rapid expansion, to a record 2.6 miles wide, effectively meant that it was closing at a much higher speed &mdash; something closer to 50 mph. The Cobalt, with four cylinders and 155 horsepower, carried three passengers, three 45-pound probes and other equipment, straining against rising winds.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now I see it,&rdquo; Young said. &ldquo;Well, maybe I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
