			<p class="lead"> His teammates hoisted the hero, as if he wasn&rsquo;t floating already.</p>
			<p>Humberto Gonzalez bobbed like a buoy above his brothers, arms and smiles stretched, and all the Adams City High School kicker could think was: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to throw me too high, and I&rsquo;m going to hit the ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Adams City had not won a football game in six years entering this past season. And yet, by twilight on this September night, when Gonzalez sliced the sky with a game-clinching field goal, Adams City had notched its fourth win of the young season.</p>
			<p>The players didn&rsquo;t know what to do. So they yelled and yelled. The graying coach hollered, &ldquo;How &rsquo;bout them Eagles?&rdquo; The players punctured the locker room&rsquo;s rare air with roars of &ldquo;Brick Squaaaaad!&rdquo; while they cradled an old brick as if it was made of gold.</p>
			<p>This was their thing, the brick. They&rsquo;d carry it to games and raise it high, a symbol of building cohesion and building their fate, brick by brick.</p>
			<p>The Denver Post spent this past football season with a forgotten community on the outskirts of Denver, literally on the other side of the tracks, where football had long been an afterthought. Adams City wasn&rsquo;t one of the teams that played Saturday for a state championship. The Eagles didn&rsquo;t make the playoffs, or for that matter, win a league game.</p>
			<p>But their struggle was real, their triumphs every bit as big as any state champion and their setbacks every bit as devastating.</p>

			<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a football story &mdash; it&rsquo;s a story about reviving a school by using football as a blueprint for change.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a journey, and along the way, you&rsquo;ll meet Dan Jajczyk, more life coach than football coach. And Juan Zazueta, a boy fast becoming a man, helping lead a household and a team. And his teammates, vulnerable kids from mostly low-income families, lined up at an early crossroads in their lives.</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s a story about what happens when a coach gives an impressionable group of kids a reason to believe — and about the improbable places that belief can carry them. It is also a story about what happens when the &ldquo;Disney&rdquo; disappears, and all that hope slams into reality like, well, a brick wall.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Their first reaction is to go right back where they were,&rdquo; said the first-year head coach, Jajczyk, a man of faith who inspires with the fervor of an evangelist. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I pray a lot. I need the courage and strength to get through that, because I&lsquo;ve got to be that beacon that takes them there. I&lsquo;m going to have to break down a lot of walls.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This season would define them, and they would help define Adams City.</p>
			<p class ="lead">A joyful countdown</p>
			<p>On Aug. 29, the night Adams City ended a 58-game losing streak, the fans counted down the clock, each number piercing the coach&rsquo;s ears.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;10 ... 9 ... 8 ...&rdquo; The fans shouted with their shoulders squeezed in the packed stands as the season opener against Thornton wound down.</p>
			<p>When he took over in March on the doorstep of Colorado&rsquo;s high school football doormat, Jajczyk (pronounced JAY-sick) told his players that a day like this was possible.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;7 ... 6 ... 5 ...&rdquo; The voices rose as the numbers dropped.</p>
			<p>Anthony Smith, the principal charged with turning around a failing school, watched adults pull out their camera phones, raise them to their tear-stained faces and point them at the scoreboard, as if the moment wouldn&rsquo;t really happen unless it was captured.</p>
			<p>Smith envisioned this moment months earlier, when he interviewed Jajczyk for the job.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He was so animated,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;He came in with a plan and a vision, raring to go. He was authentic.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;4 ... 3 ... 2 ...&rdquo; The countdown crescendoed.</p>
			<p>Long before he accepted the job, Jajczyk felt like a cursed kid. As a teenager addicted to drugs and cheap thrills, he greeted discipline with disdain. His relationship with his father, a member of the U.S. Air Force, was frayed.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I was very arrogant, very much a maverick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody could tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He realized the errors of his ways before they could haunt him. But when he embarked upon his journey as a first-time head coach, at age 56, he knew those old scars needed to resurface. They would help him connect to the impressionable kids who were making similar mistakes. He needed them to help him build.</p>
			<p>... 1!&rdquo; The final horn might as well have blared &ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Adams City 21, Thornton 8.</p>
			<p>Jajczyk stripped off his headset and raised his ribeye-sized fists into the air. His wide grin made dimples like saucers on his red cheeks. His locker-room speech was not heard but felt, the decibels rattling sternums.</p>
			<p>Antonio Scott, a running back who crossed the goal line three times that night, simply said: &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe this is all happening.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="lead"> Football as a guide</p>
			<p>Take a hard left off Highway 85 onto 72nd Avenue, past the bread factory where generations of local families have worked. Keep going — don&rsquo;t worry if your tires rumble a little over the train tracks — and soon you will pass the church where the coach prays, and the little Mexican restaurant that makes burritos as big as your head, served with Coke in a glass bottle. Just a little farther now. </p>
			<p>When the light turns green, go straight through the intersection, and you will find the school they&rsquo;re trying to save.<p>
			<p>Adams City moved into the spacious new school on Quebec Parkway in 2009, the year after it won its last football game, and the year before it went on the clock. In 2010 it was labeled a &ldquo;turnaround&rdquo; school, the lowest of five ratings the Colorado Department of Education uses to measure academic achievement.</p>
			<p> Schools branded with &ldquo;turnaround&rdquo; status have five years to reach the state&rsquo;s minimum academic and infrastructure standards, a period the state calls the &ldquo;accountability clock.&rdquo; If the standards aren&rsquo;t reached, the state can intervene and recommend drastic changes, everything from transforming the school into a charter to shutting it down.</p>
			<p>In the middle of its fourth year in the ticktock system, Adams City leaders are defiant.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Failure is not an option,&rdquo; said Smith, in his second year as executive director of school turnaround. &ldquo;We&lsquo;re going to make the progress that we need to make.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>A former college football player, Smith wanted to see what turning around the football program could do for the school&rsquo;s overall turnaround. It could be uplifting, he believed. Motivational. Contagious.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;(Football) has been a metaphor for life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You get knocked down, you get back up. You work hard, you get better. You never stop until you get to the goal you have.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When Jajczyk was hired as head coach, he was already working at the school as its director of security. He fell for this job — it just felt right. After a 20-year career in the military, he had earned a living working at an airport, a courthouse and a sporting goods store, as well as holding down assistant football coaching duties at Eaglecrest, Overland and, most recently, Chaparral.</p>
			<p>This school, with so many poor teens rich in potential — 78 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch — was the place he was meant to be. The 1,800-student body has an 83 percent Hispanic enrollment, according to the school&rsquo;s 2013-14 figures. English is the primary language for only 38 percent of the student body.</p>
			<p>The football program had been through three head coaches in seven years. Coaching friends warned him of planting roots in a &ldquo;coaches&rsquo; graveyard.&rdquo; But this was precisely why he wanted the job. He embraced the vision of helping lead change and using football as the vehicle.</p>
			<p>First, though, he would have to get the players to show up for practice.</p>
			<p class="lead">Changing a culture</p>
			<p>Some kids couldn&rsquo;t make it to practice because they needed to work to earn money to help sustain their household. Others didn&rsquo;t see the point in preparing for a game they knew they&rsquo;d lose. Marijuana use was rampant, affecting extracurricular participation. It had become such an issue that earlier this year the school adopted a pilot program called Encompass — a University of Colorado-designed model that combines substance-abuse treatment with mental health therapy.</p>
			<p>Whatever the excuse, players in past years would often go days without seeing a teammate on the field at practice, then saddle up beside him on game night because the coach needed the bodies.</p>
			<p>When Jajczyk spoke to his players for the first time last spring, he made three promises. He would never lie to them. He and his coaching staff would always outwork them. And they&rsquo;d be given everything they needed to succeed — academically and athletically.</p>
			<p>He was the bricklayer. The only way to make a change, Jajczyk determined, would be to make changes to their ways. So he got creative.</p>
			<p>He started a tribunal council. If a player made a mistake off the field, that player would be asked to stand in front of the team to explain his actions, and his sorrow. And his teammates &mdash; not the coaches &mdash; would vote, on the spot, if the kid should stay on the team. He made the brotherhood circle a safe place, where teammates could share with others personal problems in their lives, and be welcomed with acceptance.</p>
			<p>Messages became mantras. Jajczyk ordered practice uniforms, and the blinding orange shirts had the words &ldquo;Everything Matters&rdquo; emblazoned on the back. They broke huddles chanting these two sacred words like gospel. Details were the currency, the investment growing with each sweat-drenched practice, with each weekend workout during the season.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;When we used to try and have a Saturday practice in the past, maybe four people would show up,&rdquo; said Dominic Lovato, a towering left tackle. &ldquo;Now everyone is showing up.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Good coaches must pick their spots so their message doesn&rsquo;t get stale. Jajczyk understood this. He needed leaders in the ranks. Problem was, leaders can be hard to find when the mercy-rule clock is running by halftime.</p>
			<p class="lead">An emerging leader</p>
			<p>Juan Zazueta didn&rsquo;t know it, but he&rsquo;d been training for a captainship most of his life. Raised by a single mother who worked nights as a custodian to put food in the fridge, Zazueta began shepherding his two younger brothers from the time he was 9 years old.</p>
			<p>He cooked for them, helped them with homework and put them to bed inside their cramped two-bedroom apartment in Commerce City.</p>
			<p>In just one room, Juan&rsquo;s bed is jammed, corner to corner, against the bunk bed his brothers share.</p>
			<p>His social media feeds are flooded with pictures of these two. Love and compassion captured by pixels.</p>
			<p>An undersized 5-foot-10 lineman with a scruffy, untamed beard, Zazueta carried a burden like shoulder pads. His DNA was designed to nurture. He just didn&rsquo;t know how to transfer it to the field.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I never really looked at myself as a leader,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was just doing what I had to do.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jajczyk was drawn to the kid, the thumping heart of his tight junior class, which featured the left tackle Lovato, the running back Scott and Humberto&rsquo;s brother, Joseph Gonzalez, an all-league linebacker.</p>
			<p>Those were the three players who made the evening news after the season-opening victory when several TV stations made a rare trek to the other side of the tracks. Three days later, though, Adams City was hammered 48-14 by Mountain View, falling to 1-1 &mdash; and already sinking back into all its old habits.</p>
			<p>The eighth-period study hall Jajczyk set up for his team was dotted with empty chairs the following Monday. Many of those who skipped also arrived late to after-school practice, tardy cleats click-clacking on the sidewalk during prepractice stretching.</p>
			<p>Then, as the team began wind sprints, Zazueta heard a teammate deriding another for not being able to finish a run.</p>
			<p>The captain caught fire. This was a brotherhood, and you don&rsquo;t mock a brother, Zazueta shouted, puncturing his outburst with expletives.</p>
			<p>The Brick Squad had its voice. Juan Zazueta. A teenage father figure at home, he was now a Jajczyk proxy to his peers. They were building something here.</p>
			<p>That Tuesday, the coaches saw a new team.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of all the teams I&rsquo;ve coached on, there had never been one more focused during a week of practice than we were that week,&rdquo; said defensive coordinator Rob Combs.</p>
			<p>On Friday, the players flexed their muscles while yanking rope in a schoolwide game of tug of war during a pep rally. As the dark of night blanketed the town, flickering embers from the bonfire rose into the sky. Players yelled and danced and soaked in the revelry, and Jajczyk grabbed a microphone and told Commerce City&rsquo;s sons and daughters to come back for the homecoming game the next afternoon, if they wanted to see a team play full of pride.</p>
			<p>But when the team returned the next day, one of them was missing.</p>
			<p>A sinking feeling ping-ponged around Jajczyk&rsquo;s stomach, gnawing at his gut.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is not like him,&rdquo; he said, striding quickly to a pregame meeting with his team.</p>
			<p>He was right. Zazueta was never late. Juan embraced his coach&rsquo;s favorite mantra: &ldquo;Boys do what they want to do. Men do what their supposed to do.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>While his players gathered in a classroom for the meeting, Jajczyk grabbed a dry-erase marker and scribbled the letters &ldquo;AC&rdquo; on the whiteboard. Always. Committed. He preached about the importance of doing the right things for the team, about never losing a day. But his face was easier to read than his handwriting, the worry palpable.</p>
			<p>Finally, the wooden door creaked open, and the captain walked in. Jajczyk made a beeline to Zazueta, as if he was a blitzing linebacker, and gave him a bone-crunching bear hug.</p>
			<p>Zazueta recoiled.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Coach, coach, I don&rsquo;t deserve a hug,&rdquo; he said, his voice wavering. &ldquo;I let you guys down.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Zazueta spoke of a malfunctioning alarm clock, a missed ride and a long walk. About failing his teammates. All Jajczyk could hear was that his captain was safe and sound.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What should we do to him?&rdquo; Jajczyk bellowed as Zazueta took his seat among his brothers. &ldquo;Hug him!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The grinding sound of chairs moving across the ground filled the air, and the Eagles engulfed their leader.</p>
			<p class="lead">Reasons to celebrate<p>
			<p>Homecoming became a movie montage. Blurs of long touchdown runs and athletic interceptions spliced with images of a boisterous cheerleading squad waving green pompoms. The rat-tat-tat of snare drums and the low, brass roar of the marching band provided the soundtrack to a classic American football scene.</p>
			<p>With Adams City up 30-0 on Skyview late in the fourth quarter, only a matter of redemption remained.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Mauricio!&rdquo; Jajczyk yelled toward the sideline.</p>
			<p>Mauricio Hernandez, one of only seven of Adams City seniors, was the backup quarterback. </p>
			<p>Frustrated by a lack of playing time, he stopped showing up to practice. He had done it before in previous seasons, but back then, he said, &ldquo;Nobody gave a crap.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>When Hernandez returned to practice late in the week, he could see it in their faces. These guys cared for him. Jajczyk left Hernandez&rsquo;s fate up to the brotherhood. Mauricio would stay, teammates decided, but only if he gave himself to the team.</p>
			<p>Humbled by his teammates&rsquo; support, Hernandez was the biggest Eagles cheerleader on this warm Saturday afternoon.</p>
			<p>Then, late in the fourth quarter, the coach finally put him in at quarterback. Starting at the Skyview 30-yard line, Hernandez marched the offense to the goal line&rsquo;s doorstep. Fourth-and-goal at the 1.</p>
			<p>He took the snap, and darted left, absorbed a hit, twisted and stretched every inch of his rail-thin 5-foot-7 frame and ...</p>
			<p>The team, of course, screamed ...</p>
			<p>The coach, of course, hugged ...</P>
			<p>The player, of course, now appeared to believe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; Hernandez said in between gasps of that sweet air afterward. &ldquo;I feel wanted by everybody.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He now got it.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I messed up so many times, and they&rsquo;re the only ones that have never given up on me,&rdquo; he said after the 37-0 shellacking, Adams City&rsquo;s first homecoming win in a decade. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re my family, and I&rsquo;ll never give up on them.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>They won again, these Eagles. A 19-8 victory over Lincoln the next week made them 3-1. An unfamiliar word &mdash; playoffs! &mdash; circulated in the hallways of a school that couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about the team it had long ignored.</p>
			<p class ="lead">&ldquo;Enough is enough&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; the special-teams coach calmly told his boss, Jajczyk. &ldquo;I want Humberto.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>At Aurora Central the next week, just 1:20 remained. The game was tied. Adams City was setting up for a rare field-goal attempt, and the staff chose Humberto Gonzalez, a shy senior kicker, to flirt with fate.</p>
			<p>Two paces back. Two to the left. The spiraled snap cut the muggy air.</p>
			<p>This was when Adams City would become Adams City again, right? Perhaps the holder would bungle the snap? Or Humberto would shank the kick toward Park Hill?</p>
			<p>No, this was Jajczyk&rsquo;s Adams City. The ball sailed through the yellow sticks.</p>
			<p>Adams City High School was 4-1, matching their win total from the previous eight years combined.</p>
			<p>In their locker room, players held the brick high.</p>
			<p>Two days later, over syrup-soaked pancakes at his home, Jajczyk talked about the power of the brick, which had become a symbol to a group of young men learning to build, to grow, to believe.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to plant that brick (near the field), and nobody is going to touch that brick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These kids will come back three years from now to a homecoming game, and they&rsquo;ll have the pride that they were the ones who said: &lsquo;Enough is enough. We need to move on.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
			<p>But as the coach would soon discover, changing a culture meant he would have to wage battles against the heavy weight of the past.</p>

			<h3 class="storytitle">Part Two</h3>

			<p>Tyler Gallegos still felt they were brothers, even though they were no longer teammates, so the suspended senior went to senior night. Until that sobering moment he was told he must pay admission to watch. So he left before Adams City&rsquo;s final home football game, his old pickup truck rumbling into the night.</p>
			<p>Mauricio Hernandez stayed. He, too, was suspended for making poor off-field decisions and admitted he didn&rsquo;t really want to watch a game he desperately wanted to play. &ldquo;But I had to be there for my brothers,&rdquo; Mauricio said.</p>
			<p>Brothers. Brick by brick, the Adams City Eagles attempted to build a brotherhood this fall, fittingly calling themselves the &ldquo;Brick Squad.&rdquo; An old brick was their symbol, carried proudly wherever they went, be it a pep rally or the Friday night sideline. After big victories, players would hold it aloft in the locker room.</p>
			<p>But, by the final home game, it would sit in a windowsill in the field house, untouched.</p>
			<p>Adams City began the season by snapping a 58-game losing streak and racing to a 4-1 start, matching the team&rsquo;s win total from the previous eight seasons. At a struggling school &mdash; stuck with the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;turnaround&rdquo; status for poor academic performance &mdash; the football team had long been a symbol of apathy.</p>
			<p>School administrators targeted football as a vehicle to lead a school revival, change the culture and show what was possible. If the state&rsquo;s worst football program could be changed, and along the way lift spirits and show the rewards of teamwork, it would be a boon to everyone.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;These kids have things going on in their lives that are great, they just don&rsquo;t understand what greatness is,&rdquo; said the team&rsquo;s first-year coach, 56-year-old Dan Jajczyk said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t understand what success is. That&rsquo;s what we have to teach them.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Denver Post spent this past fall with the team, to chronicle the lessons of discipline, accountability and brotherhood Jajczyk tried to instill in a group of kids in need of a leader.</p>
			<p>The team captain, junior offensive guard Juan Zazueta, gravitated toward Jajczyk&rsquo;s father-figure approach and quickly cemented himself as the Eagles&rsquo; leader. But the lessons didn&rsquo;t stick with everyone. Adams City started with seven seniors and ended the season with four. The program&rsquo;s demons were hard to shake.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a generational thing, don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a cultural thing, but for some reason when things get hard around here they are used to throwing in the towel,&rdquo; said Aaron Phillips, an Adams City assistant coach and the school&rdquo;s dropout counselor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are trying to change.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>And now, here they were on senior night &mdash; a season and team frayed, still searching for hope.</p>
			<p class ="lead">Beginning of the end</p>
			<p>A slight twitch was like a light switch.</p>
			<p>Zazueta moved ever so slightly out of his crouch, and the referee catapulted the yellow flag high into the October night.</p>
			<p>False start.</p>
			<p>It was as if all the season&rsquo;s brightness went away, right then.</p>
			<p>Next came the wayward snap and a quarterback sack, followed by two thwarted runs. It was fourth-and-31 &mdash; and it was the first drive of the Eagles&rsquo; first league game, against Thompson Valley.</p>
			<p>Punt.</p>
			<p>Touchdown.</p>
			<p>Punt.</p>
			<p>Touchdown.</p>
			<p>Tears welled in the disbelieving eyes of Adams City players. Everything felt so different a week earlier. Now everything began to feel so agonizingly familiar.</p>
			<p>How did they get here?</p>
			<p>Six days earlier, the Eagles were fresh off their fourth win of the season, this one thanks to an unlikely game-winning field goal.</p>
			<p>On that Saturday, several players showed up late to practice &mdash; and a handful of them didn&rsquo;t even show up at all. Jajczyk (pronounced JAY-sick) was beginning to fully understand just how tough it was to change a culture.</p>
			<p> He ripped into his team. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking about you being great football players,&rdquo; he said, his voice booming but calm. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s coming. What I&rsquo;m talking about is how you come together to commit to one another and commit to what we&rsquo;re doing here. That&rsquo;s concerning me.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>He pointed to running back Antonio Scott, who rushed for 204 yards a day earlier in the Eagles&rsquo; fourth victory. Scott was only a few minutes late to practice, but Jajczyk wanted him setting an example.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We gave you 32 carries. And you show up late to practice? Because why? Because you think you can just do whatever you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Scott: &ldquo;No, coach.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Jajczyk: &ldquo;But you do. You don&rsquo;t even show up for practice with your cleats on.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Then, turning back to the room, he said, &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not picking on Antonio to pick on Antonio. I could look around this room and get eight to 10 of you on that. We stood on that field for 15, 20 minutes waiting for everybody who showed up late. We can&rsquo;t lie to one another. We&rsquo;re all we&rsquo;ve got. When you make a commitment to someone you&rsquo;ve got to live up to that commitment. You find a way to make it on time.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>For all the momentum of a 4-1 start, the ghosts of seasons past weren&rsquo;t going to be so easily vanquished.</p>
			<p>Coach Jajczyk, who saw so much of his own teenage vulnerability in his players, had spent weeks teaching them to believe. He taught them how to believe.</p>
			<p>And on the field against Thompson Valley, Zazueta sure believed, even with Adams City trailing 13-0. Zazueta spotted a teammate stomping angrily off the field and grabbed him by the back of the head and yelled: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the same Adams City, bro! We&rsquo;ve changed, and no one can take that away from us! Nobody ever thought we would win four games! We did that! We&rsquo;re never going back to the way it was!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Joseph Gonzalez demonstrated the Eagles&rsquo; newfound fight.</p>
			<p>The junior linebacker sprained his ankle so badly on this night he had to be helped off the field. </p>
			<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t stand the thought of standing on the sideline. He had done landscaping work for a teacher in the offseason just so he could buy his first pair of new cleats and not have to wear hand-me-downs.</p>
			<p>So Gonzalez grimaced through pain and tears and talked his way back onto the field. When Jajczyk noticed Gonzalez limping heavily in the second half, the coach sent in a backup. </p>
			<p>Gonzalez waived the sub back to the sideline. Darn it if he didn&rsquo;t think he could still play.</p>
			<p>Jajczyk had to burn a timeout to finally get Gonzalez off the field.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not letting you get hurt, son,&rdquo; Jajczyk said. &ldquo;We care too much about you.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Their character might have been as solid as a brick. But the season, man, it was beginning to crumble.</p>
			<p>With the 46-12 loss Adams City fell to 4-2.</p>
			<p>A week later, the Eagles lost 44-6 to Greeley West.</p>
			<p>But Jajczyk, this magic maker, had his Eagles still believing. He knew they needed a goal to chase, so he got them talking again about the playoffs, about a path to get the needed power points for a postseason berth. With a win at Longmont, they&rsquo;d be 5-3, assured of their first nonlosing season in a decade. And they&rsquo;d be very much alive in the playoff hunt.</p>
			<p>Adams City? Playoffs? Impossible.</p>
			<p>The Eagles flew around at practice that week sharp and efficient. The energy was infectious.</p>
			<p>And then, another distraction.</p>
			<p class= "lead">Circle of trust</p>
			<p>A few weeks earlier, two days before Adams City&rsquo;s first league game, Mauricio Hernandez strolled through a hallway at school with a grin swallowing his face. Starting quarterback Aaron Helbok was sick and was forced to miss practice, so Hernandez was about to get his shot.</p>
			<p>The gangly, 5-foot-7 kid hadn&rsquo;t played much, but that didn&rsquo;t limit his confidence.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is my chance to show what I can do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>But the very next day, on Thursday, Hernandez was perched on one knee in the middle of the field, his hand resting on his helmet. His teammates circled around him, the wind whipping around this makeshift ring of fire. Here they were again, deciding the fate of a brother.</p>
			<p>In an attempt to keep kids eligible, Jajczyk required each player to turn in weekly grade sheets from teachers &mdash; slips that helped him keep tabs on which players were struggling in which class.</p>
			<p>Hernandez knew he had a low grade in one class. He knew this was his chance to play. What was so wrong about altering his grade on the slip for coach?</p>
			<p>Well, Jajczyk found out. And so, here was Hernandez, forced to enter the circle and tell the brotherhood what he had done.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What do you think your punishment should be, Mauricio?&rdquo; asked Gonzalez, the gritty linebacker who quickly made it known he believed Hernandez should be gone. Hernandez lifted his head.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Honestly, you guys told me if I (bleeped) up again, you&rdquo;d kick me off,&rdquo; said Hernandez, who had been punished previously for skipping practice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to tell you guys. I finally thought I was going to get a chance to start, and I didn&rsquo;t want to lose it. I&rsquo;d rather be benched than mess up your whole season, because you guys have worked too hard for this.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>This scene was surreal &mdash; teenage teammates calmly policing one another in the name of a brotherhood that didn&rsquo;t even exist weeks earlier.</p>
			<p>Zazueta, who had learned responsibility by helping raise his two younger brothers, told the backup quarterback he was hurt by his selfish act &mdash; but, as captain, he favored showing mercy. Teammates were divided on what to do, but they were unified in this makeshift democratic process.</p>
			<p>These were the lessons Jajczyk was teaching. The coach didn&rsquo;t believe in simply booting troubled players to the curb. A struggling kid, without the support of his team, could only &ldquo;dig a deeper hole,&rdquo; he said.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Everybody makes mistakes and needs, time after time, to be forgiven,&rdquo; Jajczyk told his players. &ldquo;But everyone needs to be held accountable too, right? That&rsquo;s a hard balance. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re struggling to come to a common ground. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s this way.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In the end, Jajczyk decided, with input from his players, Hernandez would be suspended for two games. But Hernandez was now out of chances. One more misstep, and he was out of the brotherhood.</p>
			<p>If this were a Disney movie, Hernandez would have learned his lessons and led his team to the championship. But in Commerce City, a sweet, neat plot seldom makes the script.</p>
			<p>A few weeks later, Hernandez skipped school with teammate Tyler Gallegos, a live-wire player who previously punched an opponent. Jajczyk kicked both seniors off the team for the rest of the season.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It was a big life lesson on responsibility and accountability,&rdquo; a humbled Hernandez would later say. &ldquo;Coach was there, and when he said he was going to hold me accountable he did. It gave me a big smack in the face &mdash; that&rsquo;s what life is going to be like.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class ="lead">Cold reality</p>
			<p>Game No. 8. Longmont. By halftime, the brick sat in the dark, covered by shadows under the freezing aluminum bench on the visitors&rsquo; sideline.</p>
			<p>The Eagles talked all week about forging their path to the playoffs. The brick had been a symbol of resurgence, raised and celebrated after early-season victories.</p>
			<p>But, as the mercy-rule clock ran in the second half, the symbolic brick was lifeless, almost rendered worthless.</p>
			<p>As Adams City players gazed across the field at the opposite sideline, they saw a vibrant student section waving its arms and shouting synchronized chants: &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S ALL OV-ER! IT&rsquo;S ALL OV-ER!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Longmont 42, Adams City 0.</p>
			<p>Lacking numbers, Jajczyk was building a program emphasizing character and dedication. He had kept more than 30 players on the varsity roster nearly all season, no small feat for a program that had long struggled to find willing bodies. Still, nearly every team the Eagles played had twice as many players, many of whom seemed twice as big.</p>
			<p>One of Adams City&rsquo;s best receivers was Fabian Gutierrez, a state runner-up in wrestling a year ago &mdash; at the 106-pound weight class.</p>
			<p>As the 4-4 Eagles practiced for their final home game, freshmen and sophomores joined the workouts. For much of the past decade, Adams City didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of keeping underclassmen with their respective freshman and junior varsity teams for the entire season. Thin rosters necessitated extra bodies.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;We pulled triple duty,&rdquo; explained Matt Jacobs, a former Adams City quarterback. &ldquo;We had no choice. It got to a point where we were playing freshman, JV and varsity (games). The freshman games would be on Wednesday, the varsity game would be played on Fridays, and then we&rsquo;d play JV games on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The system made it difficult for any of those teams to improve. Games replaced practices, giving players little to no time to work with coaches and hone fundamentals, or grow together as a team.</p>
			<p>Jajczyk had made it clear from the beginning &mdash; teams would support one another, but they would be left to develop on their own. Yet, as Adams City approached its final home game, he wanted the younger players to get a taste of varsity ball.</p>
			<p>At the pregame ceremony, Adams City honored its seniors, the four who were left.</p>
			<p>By halftime, Adams City trailed Loveland by three touchdowns.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Estevon!&rdquo; Jajczyk screamed late in the game.</p>
			<p>Estevon Garcia, a slender but well-built freshman, previously told his family he was going to get his chance that night. Aunts and uncles, siblings and cousins, they were all there, donning homemade T-shirts.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going in at quarterback!&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The freshman who wore Superman cleats to practice was suddenly the varsity quarterback.</p>
			<p>Garcia came out firing, yes sir. He knew only a few of the varsity plays, but the kid improvised, unleashing strike after strike on the game&rsquo;s final drive. Three straight darts put the Eagles near midfield, but time was running out. Garcia hollered for the snap and dropped back. Receiver Steven Lippincott slid across the middle of the field, and Garcia&rsquo;s strike hit him in stride.</p>
			<p>Touchdown, Adams City. The few fans who remained roared, and it was September all over again. Jajczyk took off his hat, rubbed his graying buzz cut and grinned. It had been a long month. But the last two minutes were a welcoming reminder of the possibilities that lay ahead. </p>
			<p>When it was over, the players gathered together and sang the school fight song, making a 34-point loss feel a little less lopsided.</p>
			<p>The first person Garcia hugged was Ismael Andrade, his freshman coach. Coach Izzy, as he was called by his players, played on the last Adams City team that had won a game prior to this season, back in 2008. He was the first person in his family to graduate high school. He then became the first to graduate college. The only place he ever wanted to be was Commerce City, and nights like this were why.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I feel like a proud dad out there tonight,&rdquo; Coach Izzy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m speechless. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>As a counselor at Adams City, Coach Izzy spent countless hours with Zazueta, helping the junior explore his college options. He saw himself in Juan &mdash; not just because the two look like brothers. Not everyone makes it out of here &mdash; there&rsquo;s a 68 percent graduation rate at Adams City &mdash; but Zazueta seems to be on the same path as his mentor.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is why I wanted to be here,&rdquo; coach Izzy said. &ldquo;To see kids mature.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="lead">Hope for the future</p>
			<p>They didn&rsquo;t sit in their seats as much as they slumped, as the bus drove them away from misery and back to reality.</p>
			<p>The season was over following a 61-0 drubbing at Windsor, their worst thumping of the fall. The Eagles finished 4-6, winless since Humberto Gonzalez booted a game-winning kick six weeks earlier.</p>
			<p>But were there victories amid losing?</p>
			<p>Were the players better off than they were in August?</p>
			<p>Was there any validation to what they went through?</p>
			<p>They built a brotherhood, but they lost brothers along the way.</p>
			<p>They developed a winning identity, but they left the brick on the windowsill by the end.</p>
			<p>They absorbed the contagious passion of their coach, but they now entered a winter without football, and structure.</p>
			<p>They are &ldquo;not the same Adams City, bro!&rdquo; as Zazueta screamed during an earlier game, but how different are they?</p>
			<p>Ask the coach who led his team to the state championship game.</p>
			<p>A few days after the regular season ended, Jajczyk and the rest of the coaches from the Longs Peak League met to nominate players for the all-league team. Then, it came time to pick the league&rsquo;s coach of the year.</p>
			<p>Doug Johnson, whose Longmont team won the league and played in Saturday&rsquo;s 4A state championship, stood up and set his hand on Jajczyk&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is the guy we need to vote for coach of the year,&rdquo; Johnson told the room.</p>
			<p>Jajczyk was floored.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t win a game against anyone at this table,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All five of you beat me.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>These coaches, though, they knew the old Adams City. They didn&rsquo;t see that team this fall. </p>
			<p>The new Adams City didn&rsquo;t win often, but these coaches saw tenacity replace apathy. </p>
			<p>Nearly a month after the season ended, as he sat in a noisy breakfast diner in Aurora, Jajczyk was asked again about the brick, the organic symbol of growth his players had so proudly adopted.</p>
			<p>Five consecutive losses, multiple suspensions and a mound &mdash; no, a mountain &mdash; of frustration hadn&rsquo;t evaporated the hope.</p>
			<p>Adams City started building something special, and did so from the ground up.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;In the spring, we&rsquo;re going to get shovels and go out to that bronze eagle (statue) by the field,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want us to dig up the dirt and plant flowers in there. Then, we&rsquo;re going to put the brick in there to remind everyone that they were the ones who set that foundation.&rdquo;</p>
